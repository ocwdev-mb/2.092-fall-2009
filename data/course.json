  "course_title": "Finite Element Analysis of Solids and Fluids I",
  "course_description": "This course introduces finite element methods for the analysis of solid, structural, fluid, field, and heat transfer problems. Steady-state, transient, and dynamic conditions are considered. Finite element methods and solution procedures for linear and nonlinear analyses are presented using largely physical arguments. The homework and a term project (for graduate students) involve use of the general purpose finite element analysis program [ADINA](http://www.adina.com/). Applications include finite element analyses, modeling of problems, and interpretation of numerical results.\n",
